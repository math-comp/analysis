                  Filters and basic topological notions                     

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 This file develops tools for the manipulation of filters and basic         
 topological notions. The development of topological notions builds on      
 "filtered types". They are types equipped with an interface that           
 associates to each element a set of sets, intended to represent a filter.  
 The notions of limit and convergence are defined for filtered types and in 
 the documentation below we call "canonical filter" of an element the set   
 of sets associated to it by the interface of filtered types.

                                     These sets are intended to be filters

<a id="lab11"></a><h1 class="section">Near notations and tactics:</h1>

&gt; The purpose of the near notations and tactics is to make the         
       manipulation of filters easier. Instead of proving F G, one can      
       prove G x for x "near F", i.e. for x such that H x for H arbitrarily 
       precise as long as F H. The near tactics allow for a delayed         
       introduction of H: H is introduced as an existential variable and    
       progressively instantiated during the proof process.                 
&gt; Notations:                                                           
                      {near F, P} == the property P holds near the          
                                     canonical filter associated to F; P    
                                     must have the form forall x, Q x.      
                                     Equivalent to F Q.                     
          \forall x \near F, P x &lt;-&gt; F (fun x =&gt; P x).                      
                     \near x, P x := \forall y \near x, P x.                
                  {near F &amp; G, P} == same as {near H, P}, where H is the    
                                     product of the filters F and G.        
   \forall x \near F &amp; y \near G, P x y := {near F &amp; G, forall x y, P x y}. 
     \forall x &amp; y \near F, P x y == same as before, with G = F.            
               \near x &amp; y, P x y := \forall z \near x &amp; t \near y, P x y.  
                     x \is_near F == x belongs to a set P : in_filter F.    
&gt; Tactics:                                                             
<ul class="doclist">
<li> near=&gt; x    introduces x:                                            
       On the goal \forall x \near F, G x, introduces the variable x and an 
       "existential", and unaccessible hypothesis ?H x and asks the user to 
       prove (G x) in this context.                                         
       Under the hood delays the proof of F ?H and waits for near: x        
       Also exists under the form near=&gt; x y.                               

</li>
<li> near: x     discharges x:                                            
       On the goal H_i x, and where x \is_near F, it asks the user to prove 
       that (\forall x \near F, H_i x), provided that H_i x does not depend 
       on variables introduced after x.                                     
       Under the hood, it refines by intersection the existential variable  
       ?H attached to x, computes the intersection with F, and asks the     
       user to prove F H_i, right now                                       

</li>
<li> end_near should be used to close remaining existentials trivially    

</li>
<li> near F =&gt; x     poses a variable near F, where F is a proper filter  
       adds to the context a variable x that \is_near F, i.e. one may       
       assume H x for any H in F. This new variable x can be dealt with     
       using  near: x, as for variables introduced by near=&gt;.
