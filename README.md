## Building and installation instructions

The easiest way to install the latest released version of Analysis library compatible with Mathematical Components
is via [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):

```shell
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq-mathcomp-analysis
```

To instead build and install manually, do:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/math-comp/analysis.git
cd analysis
make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine> 
make install
```


## Disclaimer

This library is still at an experimental stage.  Contents may
change, definitions and theorems may be renamed, and inference
mechanisms may be replaced at any major version bump.  Use at your
own risk.

## Documentation

Each file is documented in its header.

Changes are documented in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and
[CHANGELOG_UNRELEASED.md](CHANGELOG_UNRELEASED.md).

## Mathematical structures

MathComp-Analysis adds mathematical structures on top of MathComp's ones.
The following inheritance diagram displays the resulting hiearchy
(excluding `finGroupType`, `countalg`, `finalg`, and some `order` structures).
The structures and inheritance introduced by MathComp-Analysis are highlighted.
The dotted inheritance edges to the `numFieldType` structure are enabled only
when one imports `numFieldNormedType.Exports`.

## Previous work reused at the time of the first releases

This library was inspired by the [Coquelicot library](http://coquelicot.saclay.inria.fr/)
by Sylvie Boldo, Catherine Lelay, and Guillaume Melquiond.
`topology.v` and `normedtype.v` contained a reimplementation of file
`Hierarchy.v` from the library Coquelicot.

The instantiation of the mathematical structures of the Mathematical Components library
with the real numbers of the standard Coq library used a well-known file (`Rstruct.v`)
from the [CoqApprox library](http://tamadi.gforge.inria.fr/CoqApprox/) (with
modifications from various authors).

Our proof of Zorn's Lemma in `classical_sets.v` (NB: new filename) is a reimplementation
of the one by Daniel Schepler (https://github.com/coq-community/zorns-lemma); we also took
inspiration from his work on topology (https://github.com/coq-community/topology) for parts
of `topology.v`.

[ORIGINAL_FILES.md](ORIGINAL_FILES.md) gives more details about the
files in the first releases.
