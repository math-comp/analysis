UNSTABLE/DRAFT Analysis library compatible with Mathematical Components
=======================================================================

## Contents

This repository contains an experimental library for real analysis
for the Coq proof-assistant and using the Mathematical Components
library.

It is inspired by the [Coquelicot library]. The instantiation of the
mathematical structures of the Mathematical Components library with
the real numbers of the standard Coq library uses a well-known file
(Rstruct.v) from the [CoqApprox library] (with modifications from various
authors).
