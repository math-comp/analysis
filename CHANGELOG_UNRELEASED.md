- in `kernel.v`:
  + `kseries` is now an instance of `Kernel_isSFinite_subdef`
- in `classical_sets.v`:
  + lemma `setU_id2r`
- in `lebesgue_measure.v`:
  + lemma `compact_measurable`

- in `measure.v`:
  + lemmas `outer_measure_subadditive`, `outer_measureU2`

- in `lebesgue_measure.v`:
  + declare `lebesgue_measure` as a `SigmaFinite` instance
  + lemma `lebesgue_regularity_inner_sup`

- in file `lebesgue_integral.v`,
  + new lemmas `integral_le_bound`, `continuous_compact_integrable`, and 
    `lebesgue_differentiation_continuous`.

- in `normedtype.v`:

### Changed

- `mnormalize` moved from `kernel.v` to `measure.v` and generalized
- in `constructive_ereal.v`:
  + `lee_adde` renamed to `lee_addgt0Pr` and turned into a reflect
  + `lee_dadde` renamed to `lee_daddgt0Pr` and turned into a reflect
- in `lebesgue_integral.v`
  + rewrote `negligible_integral` to replace the positivity condition
    with an integrability condition, and added `ge0_negligible_integral`.
